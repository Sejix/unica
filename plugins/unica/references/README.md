# Unica References

Use this index when a skill needs background guidance beyond its own `SKILL.md`.

## Provenance

The previous upstream-shaped folders were intentionally removed. Reference
content is now maintained as Unica guidance; provenance is available from git
history, not from duplicated source trees.
