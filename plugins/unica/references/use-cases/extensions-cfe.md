# Extensions CFE

## When to use

Use this when the user needs to create a configuration extension, validate it,
borrow configuration objects into it, inspect its differences, or generate a
method interceptor.

Do not use this for ordinary metadata object edits in the base configuration.
Use metadata-modeling references and `unica.meta.*` for that.

## Primary path

Use native CFE tools through MCP `unica`:

- `unica.cfe.init`
- `unica.cfe.validate`
- `unica.cfe.diff`
- `unica.cfe.borrow`
- `unica.cfe.patch_method`

Runtime export or loading of `.cfe` artifacts is handled by `v8-runner`
with `operation=make` or `operation=load`.
